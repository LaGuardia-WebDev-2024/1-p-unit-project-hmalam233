      <p>How to get away with murder is my favorite murder mystery show. It's centered around a 
        criminal defense attorney and teacher Annalise Keating. when a crime is committed amongst the 5 students she chose 
        to work at her lawfirm, many twists and turns of events occur overtime in the entire series. here are the reasons why you should watch the show.
